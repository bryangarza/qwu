Type of ~runInsertReturning~ is:

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
runInsertReturning :: Default QueryRunner returned haskells =>
                      Connection ->
                      Table columnsW columnsR ->
                      columnsW ->
                      (columnsR -> returned) ->
                      IO [haskells]
#+END_SRC

You have to write out the type of ~IO [haskells]~ (whether that be ~Int~,
~UUID~, whatever) so that the function can return a concrete type, otherwise it
doesn't know what to return.

~[haskells]~ is the type var for what is returning... ~deckId~ is an ~Int~, so
therefore we have ~IO [Int]~ as the return type.

~returned~ and ~haskells~ are constrained by the same typeclass, as they are
representing the same exact 'thing' being returned.
